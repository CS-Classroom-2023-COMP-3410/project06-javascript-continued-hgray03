The new feature I attempted to add was making the website responsive.
This feature is reasonable, for we live in an age where there are many different sizes of screens.
It's supposed to work by allowing the website to work on all sorts of screen types without fail.
ChatGPT doesn't do responsiveness well, so it didn't understand what I was trying to ask it to do.
